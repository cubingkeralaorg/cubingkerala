// Astro's own fetch handler — the adapter has no built-in Cron Trigger
// support, this is the officially documented "custom worker entry file"
// pattern (import handle from @astrojs/cloudflare/handler, export a
// standard ExportedHandler). Relative imports throughout, not the `@/*`
// alias — this file is bundled directly by wrangler, not through Astro's
// own Vite pipeline, so there's no guarantee tsconfig paths resolve here.
//
// Ported from the Next.js app's /api/cron/sync-wca route — same two calls,
// same options — just triggered by a native Cron Trigger instead of a
// CRON_SECRET-guarded HTTP endpoint (see wrangler.jsonc's [triggers] and
// the plan doc's "Cron" decision).
//
// --- Edge caching + rate limiting ---
// Every page here is SSR (astro.config.mjs's output: 'server') and does at
// least one D1 round trip, with zero caching anywhere — repeatedly hitting
// several routes (e.g. manual perf testing, or a scraper) re-runs all of
// that on every single request. On the Workers Free plan that's what was
// tripping the "exceeded resource limits" error: there's no code-level dial
// to raise the ~10ms CPU/request cap, so the only way to stay under it is
// to do the expensive work (D1 queries + Astro rendering) less often.
// Two layers, applied only to the page routes below (never to /api/* or
// POST requests, which already set their own no-store headers):
//   1. Caching: a cache hit skips D1 + rendering entirely. Anonymous
//      visitors get this on repeat clicks (edge cache + browser cache,
//      see below); authenticated ones only get it via <ClientRouter />
//      (Layout.astro) skipping the full-page-reload cost, not via
//      caching — see the Cache-Control comment further down for why.
//   2. Rate limiter: a backstop against sustained bursts across many
//      distinct/uncached URLs (bots, load tests), independent of caching.
//
// Every page goes through Layout.astro (src/layouts/Layout.astro), which
// reads the "userInfo" cookie to compute isLoggedIn/isAdmin — and even the
// viewer's own email for the footer — for literally every route, not just
// /members. Two different caches are in play, with two different rules,
// because they have very different sharing properties:
//
//   1. Cloudflare's edge Cache API (`caches.default`) — SHARED across every
//      visitor who hits the same URL. Anonymous-only: a logged-in render
//      written here would leak that visitor's login state (and email) to
//      the next, unrelated visitor of the same URL. (Tried keying it
//      per-visitor instead of excluding auth entirely — see the note
//      below; reverted, it didn't work.)
//   2. The requesting browser's own HTTP cache. Anonymous responses get a
//      real `max-age` here too — safe, since anonymous content never
//      varies by visitor, so there's nothing to leak. Authenticated
//      responses deliberately do NOT — see the big comment on the
//      Cache-Control line below for why a real max-age there caused a
//      real, visible bug (the navbar flickering between Login/Logout
//      while clicking around logged in).
//
// Tried (and reverted): keying the EDGE cache per-visitor by folding the
// cookie's value into the cache key, so a logged-in visitor's repeat click
// could hit a dedicated edge cache entry. Cloudflare's Cache API silently
// failed to persist anything written under that scheme — cache.put()
// resolved without error, but an immediate self-verifying cache.match()
// for the identical key right after still came back empty, consistently,
// regardless of TTL, Cache-Control value, or how the key Request was
// constructed. Isolated it to "a real auth cookie was present on the
// request" specifically — not the D1 queries Layout.astro does for a real
// cookie (reproduced with no D1 work at all), not the key string (an
// authenticated key byte-identical to a working anonymous one still
// failed), not timing. Couldn't find the actual cause, so not shipping
// edge-cache writes that have been proven not to reliably work.
//
// Tried (and reverted): giving authenticated responses a real
// `private, max-age=N` browser-cache TTL too, so even logged-in repeat
// clicks would skip the network. Broke correctness instead: the browser's
// HTTP cache is keyed purely by URL, with no concept of "this entry was
// for a different cookie" (no Vary: Cookie here, and Vary on Cookie isn't
// practically usable — it would vary per literal cookie value, defeating
// caching entirely). A page cached while anonymous — normal, happens on
// every first visit before logging in — would then get served as-is
// after logging in, with zero server round trip, for up to that TTL:
// Login/Logout and the admin Requests link would flicker depending on
// which pages still had a stale pre-login entry. src/pages/api/auth/
// callback.ts sends `Clear-Site-Data: "cache"` on login specifically to
// invalidate any such pre-login entries (logout doesn't need this —
// authenticated responses are never freely-reusable-cached in the first
// place, so there's nothing stale for it to leave behind).
